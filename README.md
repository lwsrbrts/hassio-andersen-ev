# Andersen EV Chargepoint integration for Home Assistant

![Andersen Logo](/images/dark_logo.png)

## Status

### Beta 0.5.1

## Features
* Switch entities for each charging schedule allows enabling/disabling charge schedules.
* Lock entity to enable or disable the charge point.
* Provides services to:
  * Disable all charging schedules: `andersen_ev.disable_all_schedules`
  * Get detailed device information: `andersen_ev.get_device_info` (results displayed in UI)
  * Get detailed real-time device status: `andersen_ev.get_device_status` (results displayed in UI)

## Installation
Sorry, no HACS just yet. It may come.

1. Download the repository as a zip file and extract it.
2. Copy the `andersen_ev` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Add the integration via the Home Assistant UI by providing your Andersen user account user name and password.

## Services
The integration provides the following services:

### disable_all_schedules
Disables all charging schedules for a specified device.

Example:
```yaml
service: andersen_ev.disable_all_schedules
data:
  device_id: "YOUR_DEVICE_ID"
```

### get_device_info
Retrieves detailed information about a device and displays the results directly in the Home Assistant UI. This service uses Home Assistant's new Action API that allows returning data to the user interface.

Example:
```yaml
service: andersen_ev.get_device_info
data:
  device_id: "YOUR_DEVICE_ID"
```

### get_device_status
Retrieves detailed real-time status of a device and displays the results directly in the Home Assistant UI. This provides more comprehensive status information than what is available through the sensors.

Example:
```yaml
service: andersen_ev.get_device_status
data:
  device_id: "YOUR_DEVICE_ID"
```

## Future development
Frankly depends on whether or not I sell my house (with the charger).
