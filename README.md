# Andersen EV Chargepoint integration for Home Assistant

* Developed on an Andersen A2 device installed in 2019.
* The primary feature of this integration is that it implements a Home Assistant lock for the Andersen A2. It also pulls some useful sensors from the API using a GraphQL query. I personally don't get good results from these sensors but then, I never have from the mobile app either. ü§∑üèª
* The lock state is updated almost instantly, other sensors are refreshed on a 60 second cycle.
* Uses [@iandbird's](https://github.com/IanDBird/konnect) baseline Python module and slightly modifies it to suit some additional sensors.

## Installation
Sorry, no HACS just yet. It may come.

1. Download the repository as a zip file and extract it.
2. Copy the `andersen_ev` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Add the integration via the Home Assistant UI by providing your Andersen user account user name and password.

## Future development
Frankly depends on whether or not I sell my house (with the charger).
