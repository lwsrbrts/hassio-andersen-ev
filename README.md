# Andersen EV Chargepoint integration for Home Assistant

## Status

### Beta 0.4.1.

## Features
* Developed on an Andersen A2 device installed in 2019.
* The primary feature of this integration is that it implements a Home Assistant lock for the Andersen A2. It also pulls some useful sensors from the API using a GraphQL query. I personally don't get good results from these sensors but then, I never have from the mobile app either. ü§∑üèª
* The lock state is updated almost instantly, other sensors are refreshed on a 60 second cycle.
* Uses [@iandbird's](https://github.com/IanDBird/konnect) baseline Python module and slightly modifies it to suit some additional sensors.
* Implements automatic token refresh to maintain persistent connections to the Andersen EV API.
* All sensors feature custom Material Design icons for better visual distinction in the Home Assistant dashboard.
* Provides services to:
  * Disable all charging schedules: `andersen_ev.disable_all_schedules`
  * Get detailed device information: `andersen_ev.get_device_info` (results displayed in UI)
  * Get detailed real-time device status: `andersen_ev.get_device_status` (results displayed in UI)

## Installation
Sorry, no HACS just yet. It may come.

1. Download the repository as a zip file and extract it.
2. Copy the `andersen_ev` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Add the integration via the Home Assistant UI by providing your Andersen user account user name and password.

## Services
The integration provides the following services:

### disable_all_schedules
Disables all charging schedules for a specified device.

Example:
```yaml
service: andersen_ev.disable_all_schedules
data:
  device_id: "YOUR_DEVICE_ID"
```

### get_device_info
Retrieves detailed information about a device and displays the results directly in the Home Assistant UI. This service uses Home Assistant's new Action API that allows returning data to the user interface.

Example:
```yaml
service: andersen_ev.get_device_info
data:
  device_id: "YOUR_DEVICE_ID"
```

### get_device_status
Retrieves detailed real-time status of a device and displays the results directly in the Home Assistant UI. This provides more comprehensive status information than what is available through the sensors.

Example:
```yaml
service: andersen_ev.get_device_status
data:
  device_id: "YOUR_DEVICE_ID"
```

## Future development
Frankly depends on whether or not I sell my house (with the charger).

## Changelog

### 0.4.1
* Added custom Material Design icons for all sensors
* Added service:
  * `get_device_status` - Retrieves detailed real-time device status with results displayed in UI

### 0.4.0
* Added services:
  * `disable_all_schedules` - Disables all charging schedules for a charge point
  * `get_device_info` - Retrieves detailed device information with results displayed in UI
  * `get_device_status` - Retrieves detailed real-time device status with results displayed in UI
* Removed redundant enable/disable charging services (use the lock entity instead)
* Changed power sensors to display in kilowatts (kW) to match API values

### 0.3.0
* Implemented automatic token refresh to fix the "No devices found" issue after 1 hour
  * This still uses a full authentication, which isn't ideal but refresh tokens just don't work. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* Added better error handling for authentication failures
* Improved logging for better troubleshooting

### 0.2.0
